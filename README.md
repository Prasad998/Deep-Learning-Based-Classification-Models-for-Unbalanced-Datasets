# Deep-Learning-Based-Classification-Models-for-Unbalanced-Datasets

Addressing imbalanced data in classification problems for better performance on minority classes.

– Motivation: Vital for fraud detection and disease diagnosis, especially for ensuring high recall on minority classes.

– Project Focus: Aims improve F1-scores using deep learning for dataset on telecom customer churn prediction.

– Methods: Undersampling, Oversampling, SMOTE, and Ensemble Learning techniques used to address data imbalance.
